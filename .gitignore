# --- Data Management (Bioinformatics) ---
# We want to keep the folder structure, but ignore the large data files
data/raw/*
data/processed/*
data/logs/*

# Exception: Keep the empty folder placeholders so git tracks the directories
!data/raw/.gitkeep
!data/processed/.gitkeep
!data/logs/.gitkeep

# Safety Net: Ignore common large bio/data formats globally
